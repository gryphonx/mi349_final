                <p>My name is Joey Griffin. I am a junior at Michigan State University, studying
                    Information Management and Science within the college of Communication Arts
                    and Sciences. I enjoy working at internships and in my free time, I find time
                    to work with computer software, designing websites, and practing programming
                    languages. I am hoping to find an internship out of college where I can 
                    practice dealing with different forms of media, as well as an internship where
                    I can be an IT assisant. Above in the navigation bar is a link to my idea of
                    a company that deals with web service managment and consultants, called HEXAGON. 
                    In the future I hope to work with people to create, build, and support many
                    different websites.
